# Fiskalizacija2 C# Implementation

This folder contains an evolving C# port of the core `FiskalizacijaClient` from the
original TypeScript project. It provides basic data structures, an XML signer,
and utilities for SOAP envelope generation, HTTP communication, error handling
and time formatting. Full XML model support and request/response parsing have
not yet been implemented.
