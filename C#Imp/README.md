# Fiskalizacija2 C# Implementation

This folder contains an initial C# port of the core `FiskalizacijaClient` from the
original TypeScript project. It provides basic data structures and a skeleton
implementation for signing and SOAP envelope generation. HTTP communication and
full XML model support have not yet been implemented.
