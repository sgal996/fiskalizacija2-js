# Fiskalizacija2 C# Implementation

This folder contains an evolving C# port of the original TypeScript project.
It now includes builders for generating request objects, basic XML models,
certificate and XML utility helpers, an XML signer, HTTP helpers, error
handling and time formatting. The implementation is still incomplete and
does not yet cover the entire XML specification or full request/response
parsing.
